 ;;; There are a few VShell parameters which you can adjust to meet your needs by
 ;;; running the PARAM System QWIK. Type ..PARAM at the '>>' prompt. The following
 ;;; parameters can be set:
 ;;;
 ;;;   Global Kill: NO/YES
 ;;;                If you enter code at the '>>' prompt that is killing a
 ;;;                global, you will be warned and asked if you want the code
 ;;;                executed. The default answer to that question is setable here.
 ;;;
 ;;;   Prompt: ACTIVE/INACTIVE
 ;;;                If Prompt is set to INACTIVE, the VShell's prompt will be
 ;;;                '>>'. If Prompt is ACTIVE, the VShell's prompt will include
 ;;;                UCI and Volume Set. Example: VAH,ROU>>
 ;;;
 ;;;   Time-out: SECONDS
 ;;;                You can set the length of time before the VShell times out
 ;;;                from inactivity. Enter the time out length in seconds.
 ;;;
 ;;;   SAVE Routine: ROUTINE NAME
 ;;;                The routine entered here will be the default routine when
 ;;;                you run System QWIK ..QSAVE, to save your User QWIKs.
 ;;;                ..QSAVE is also used to restore your previously saved QWIKs.
 ;;;                NOTE: It is your responsibility to insure that the routine
 ;;;                entered here doesn't already exist. If it does, it will
 ;;;                be overwritten.
 ;;;
 ;;;   <DEL> different from <BS>
 ;;;                When set to DIFF, the <BS> key (8) deletes the character to
 ;;;                the left of the cursor, and the <DEL> key (127) deletes the
 ;;;                character under the cursor. When set to SAME, both the <BS>
 ;;;                and <DEL> keys delete the character to the left of the
 ;;;                cursor. You can do ..KEY to see what your <BS> key is
 ;;;                sending. If it's sending 127, the same as your <DEL> key and
 ;;;                you want these keys to delete the character to the left of
 ;;;                the cursor, set this parameter to SAME.
 ;;;
 ;;;   Screen Width: NUMBER
 ;;;                You can set the width of the screen used by the VPE UI.
 ;;;                By default, the width is set automatically, based on the
 ;;;                size of your terminal (or terminal emulator) window. If you
 ;;;                want to reset the width so that it uses the default auto
 ;;;                width, enter 0. The VPE UI will be resized in real time.
 ;;;                Note that some UI elements may not fit properly within a
 ;;;                screen width smaller than 80.
 ;;;
 ;;;   Screen Length: NUMBER
 ;;;                You can set the length of the screen used by the VPE UI.
 ;;;                By default, the length is set automatically, based on the
 ;;;                size of your terminal (or terminal emulator) window. If you
 ;;;                want to reset the length so that it uses the default auto
 ;;;                length, enter 0. The VPE UI will be resized in real time.
 ;;;                Note that some UI elements may not fit properly within a
 ;;;                screen length smaller than 24.
 ;;;
 ;;;   Highlight Syntax: ON/OFF
 ;;;                You can turn syntax highlighting mode on or off. It defaults
 ;;;                to off. When it is on, syntax highlighting will highlight
 ;;;                nine syntax regions with different colors.
 ;;;
 ;;;   Configure Syntax: SUB-MENU
 ;;;                This opens up a sub-menu that allows you to configure the
 ;;;                foreground and background colors for each of the nine syntax
 ;;;                regions. This menu option is only accessible when syntax
 ;;;                highlighting is turned on. In order to reset the syntax
 ;;;                highlighting colors to the system defaults, enter 0.
 ;;;
 ;;; V S H E L L   T I M E   O U T
 ;;;
 ;;; If no activity occurs at the '>>' prompt, the VShell will time out. It will
 ;;; then look to see if you have a User QWIK named TO, and execute it. You can
 ;;; set TO to run any M code you'd like. Setting TO="HALT" will cause the VShell
 ;;; to quit.
